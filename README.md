### Hi there, I'm Zakaria 👋

**Lead Data & Performance | Power BI Expert | Full-Stack Builder**

Based in Lyon, France 🇫🇷.  
By day, I act as a **Business Partner** & **Data Lead** for global industry giants (Sanofi, Volvo, Club Med context), bridging the gap between complex data and strategic decisions.  
By night, I am a **"Vibe Coder"**—I build products, explore modern stacks (Next.js 15, Supabase), and turn cultural passions into data intelligence.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

I don't just analyze data; I build the platforms that generate it.

#### 🎉 [JiMerhba.com](https://jimerhba.com)
> *The Authentic Moroccan Wedding Marketplace.*

A production-ready SaaS connecting international guests with authentic Moroccan wedding experiences. I built this to digitize a traditional industry with modern trust & verification workflows.
* **The "Vibe":** Dual-role marketplace (Host/Guest), ID Verification system, and bilingual support.
* **The Tech:** Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Prisma, Tailwind CSS 4.
* **Status:** 🟢 Production Ready (99.9% Complete).

#### 🦁 **BotolaStats - Football Intelligence Platform**
> *Data Engineering meets the Beautiful Game.*

The definitive database for Moroccan football (Botola Pro). I architected a pipeline to track 5 seasons, 1,200+ fixtures, and real-time market values where official data was missing.
* **The "Vibe":** "Always Works™" methodology. Expert-validated data vs. automated scraping.
* **The Tech:** Python (Complex ETL), SQL (32 optimized indexes), Power BI, Data Engineering.
* **Status:** 🟢 Live Data Pipeline (5 Complete Seasons).
